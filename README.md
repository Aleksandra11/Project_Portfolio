## Project Portfolio Mockup to HTML

Developed a personal portfolio page using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap framework. The page is responsive and works on mobile, tablet and desktop browsers. The portfolio has links to the other projects I completed throughout the course of the _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_.
